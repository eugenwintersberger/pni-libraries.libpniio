    //!
    //! The image_reader class provides the basic functionality for all other
    //! image readers. It opens the file and provides a stream from which to
    //! read data. ImageReader objects cannot be copied or copy-assigned. 
    //! However, they can be moved using std::move. 
    //!
    //! Like data_reader (from which it is derived) an ImageReader object 
    //! cannot be instantiated using this class. All constructors and 
    //! assignment operators are thus protected making them only available 
    //! to derived classes.
